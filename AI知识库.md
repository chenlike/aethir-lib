Aethir Whitepaper
2024 v1.0

Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the single most important technology we‚Äôve ever seen. But
what only a relative few can see is the imminent transformation of life as we know it once
artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved‚Äîas soon as 2027, by some accounts.
Whoever is first to roll it out at scale will be granted an unprecedented level of control
over the future of humanity.
The race to AGI has created a thirst for compute so insatiable that there is no conceivable
scenario where demand can be met. This has sent big tech, governments, and anyone
else with the resources scrambling to secure enough GPU chips, spending tens of billions
in the process. For those without the resources, they are stuck relying on expensive cloud
compute providers.
Decentralized physical infrastructure networks, or DePINs have emerged as an
alternative. As distributed networks of aggregated small-scale infrastructure, they are
designed to support rapid scale. In the compute context, this means GPU chips owned by
data centers, tech companies, telecom companies, top gaming studios, and crypto mining
companies
As we move towards AGI, we are confronted with a problem that stands to alter the
course of humanity if left unchecked: the unfair distribution of outcomes that stems from
a handful of companies controlling a technology as important as AI. The widening AI
wealth gap between the GPU Rich and GPU Poor is tilting the balance heavily in favor of
big tech.
In response, we need to increase the accessibility of on-demand compute so that AI
companies can claw control away from big tech and produce the innovative outcomes
that will ensure AI is developed for the good of humanity. The only way to do this is by
leveraging the power of DePINs to create a distributed network of affordable compute
resources accessible by all.
Aethir has built this distributed network. It aggregates enterprise-grade GPU chips into a
single global network that increases the supply of on-demand cloud compute resources
for the AI, gaming, and virtualized compute sectors. Enterprise GPU owners can unlock
the revenue potential of their underutilized GPU chips, while end users get access to the
affordable on-demand compute resources they need to power their AI training and
inferencing workloads, real-time rendering applications, and other virtualized compute
operations.
1
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
What differentiates Aethir from other cloud compute infrastructure is its ability to scale to
meet the demands of rapid AI and cloud gaming growth. Its distributed model is designed
to streamline network expansion so that it can deliver the most optimal and affordable
compute resources on demand to wherever they are needed. Five key features make this
possible:
‚óè Enterprise-grade compute resources
‚óè Low latency to support real-time rendering and AI inferencing use cases
‚óè A distributed model that can scale much faster than its centralized counterpart
‚óè Superior unit economics that make on-demand compute resources affordable
‚óè Decentralized ownership that allows resource owners to retain control
Aethir is powering the future of gaming. It‚Äôs the only cloud compute infrastructure
designed specifically to support real-time rendering at scale for mobile and PC cloud
gaming. It can serve gamers across geographies with a seamless, low-latency experience
without the need for high-end hardware.
It‚Äôs also enabling the evolution of AI interaction, through a combination of real-time
rendering and AI inferencing that requires compute infrastructure not yet accessible
outside of big tech. Aethir‚Äôs real-time rendering infrastructure is the foundation on which
innovators can revolutionize the way we interact with AI models and enable the kind of
innovation that will bring AI truly into everyday life.
As a DePIN, Aethir leverages Web3 to enable incentivization and consumption tracking.
Resource owners are rewarded in Aethir‚Äôs native $ATH token for providing resources to
the network, while blockchain is used to track resource consumption by end users and
facilitate the transfer of rewards.
Aethir‚Äôs cloud compute infrastructure network supports a number of critical use cases,
including AI model training, AI inferencing, cloud gaming, cloud phone, and AI
productization. In each case, its capability for scalable, affordable, low-latency compute
can keep up with the demands of innovation in these areas.
The network consists of 3 core roles: Container, Checker, and Indexer. Containers,
including the Aethir Edge, are where the actual utilization of the compute resources takes
place. Checkers ensure the integrity and performance of the Containers. Where required,
Indexers match end users with suitable Containers based on end-user requirements.
Together, they ensure that Aethir can deliver the highest-quality compute to support
rapid AI and cloud gaming growth.

Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Market Context
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the single most important technology we‚Äôve ever seen. To truly
understand Aethir‚Äôs impact on AI‚Äôs future, we first need to look at where AI is today, where
it‚Äôs going, the state of the graphics processing unit (GPU) industry, and the rise of
decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs).
The Future of AI
Bullish economic forecasts by today‚Äôs generation of research report leaders fail to capture
AI‚Äôs true potential for impact. Estimates such as a US$15.7 trillion contribution to the
global economy by 2030 may make headlines, but they miss the point. AI isn‚Äôt about
economics, it‚Äôs about the future of the human race. Through that lens, AI‚Äôs impact can‚Äôt be
understated.
This may not be so obvious today, however. The first generation of generative AI
solutions‚ÄîChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini, and others‚Äîoffer glimpses of the future but are
really just scraping the surface of what‚Äôs possible. What only a relative few can see is the
imminent transformation of life as we know it once artificial general intelligence (AGI) is
achieved‚Äîas soon as 2027, by some accounts.
What will that life look like? Fundamentally different, in short. The monotony, the long
commutes, the menial labor, the subsistence farming will all be relics of our current
industrial age. AGI-powered agents and robots will be able to do nearly everything for us,
and our interaction with them will be via real-time rendered avatars, not keyboards.
This will make a vast majority of current jobs redundant‚Äîas many as 300 million by 2030,
according to a report by Goldman Sachs‚Äîbut the inevitable introduction of universal
basic income schemes will enable a transition to a post-work society with greater
economic equality. We will, for the first time, be able to choose the life we want to live, not
work solely for the sake of survival.
Given what‚Äôs at stake, it should come as no surprise that a great AI arms race has begun.
And there has never been a more important race. Whoever is first to achieve AGI and roll
it out at scale will be entitled to enormous wealth and, more importantly, granted an
unprecedented level of control over the future of humanity. The nuclear arms race and its
importance to geopolitical supremacy is the closest parallel we have. The US alone spent
an estimated US$5.5 trillion (in 1996 dollars) between 1940 and 1996 to entrench its
3
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
position as a superpower. Companies working on AI are well on their way to that level of
expenditure.
Big tech‚ÄîGoogle, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft‚Äîis leading the charge. They‚Äôve already
spent hundreds of billions on compute resources, modular power plants, power contracts,
and human talent in an attempt to control the development of AI and its component parts.
The discussion is no longer about multi-billion dollar compute clusters. They‚Äôre now
talking trillion-dollar clusters as the foundation for the race to AGI.
Cash-rich governments have also joined the party. The UAE, for one, has its sights set on
becoming an AI power. (OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman famously sought US$7 trillion from the
country to build a competitor to NVIDIA.) Not to be outdone is the US$350 billion gaming
industry and its real-time rendering capabilities that are critical to evolving our interaction
with AI. Real-time rendering on its own is a market that‚Äôs set to grow to nearly US$4 billion
by 2033.
Such intense competition means it is no longer a question of if we‚Äôll transition to a
post-work future but when. A key indicator of how quickly we get there are the GPU chips
that power the training and inferencing computations.
The State of the GPU Industry
GPU demand has become a new global constant. The race to win AI has created a thirst
for compute resources so insatiable that there is no conceivable scenario where demand
can be met. To put it in perspective, Moore‚Äôs law states that hardware efficiency doubles
every 18 months. One estimate suggests that GPU demand is growing 10 times over that
same period.
For example, it took an estimated 3,000-10,000x more compute to go from GPT-2 (2019)
to GPT-4 (2023)‚Äîa jump in intelligence, experts say, that‚Äôs equivalent to evolving from a
preschooler to a smart high school student. It‚Äôs not difficult to imagine just how much
more compute will be needed to get to AGI and beyond.
One company, NVIDIA, controls some 70% of the estimated US$65 billion GPU market
because it‚Äôs the only company that can produce the battle-tested GPUs coveted by AI
and gaming. Predictably, due to its own resource constraints, the company isn‚Äôt able to
produce enough GPU chips to meet demand. Those it does produce have sparked
controversy around how they are allocated, with the CEO, Jensen Huang, having to state
in February 2024, ‚ÄúWe allocate fairly.‚Äù
One commentator, in November 2023, put the supply gap north of half a million chips.
4
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
This has had a far-reaching impact on the AI industry, even threatening to slow its
development. It has sent anyone with a horse in the race scrambling for GPU chips. Those
with means‚Äîbig tech‚Äîare investing heavily to maintain their post position. Meta spent
US$10 billion on 350,000 NVIDIA H100 chips; Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are all
building their own proprietary chips; and the proliferation of cloud GPU providers are
snapping up chips to make available on demand.
Those without the means are forced to rely on the proverbial scraps‚Äîslower GPUs and
even CPUs‚Äîor expensive on-demand resources from cloud GPU providers. To no one‚Äôs
surprise, today‚Äôs cloud GPU infrastructure is dominated by Microsoft, Amazon Web
Services (AWS), Google, and even NVIDIA. But alternative players, such as CoreWeave,
are also making noise and attracting billions in investment.
An important point is that GPU chips sold to companies other than hyperscalers and
cloud GPU providers have no meaningful impact on compute supply. Even if they wanted
to, these companies don‚Äôt have the capabilities to make these resources available via
cloud infrastructure. While difficult to quantify with any certainty, there are likely
hundreds of millions of these GPU chips sitting underutilized (an estimated 15-25%
utilization rate) inside tech companies, enterprises, data centers, and cryptocurrency
mining companies. Unlocking access to these resources is enough to materially affect the
supply of compute resources.
The Rise of DePIN
Decentralized physical infrastructure networks, or DePINs, are based on the idea that you
can use blockchain and cryptocurrency to build distributed networks of aggregated
small-scale infrastructure, such as energy, compute, wireless, AI, and sensors. On the
supply side, cryptocurrency is used to incentivize owners to contribute their resources,
while the blockchain is used to track consumption on the demand side and facilitate
payments to the owners.
A good example is decentralized storage. People with underutilized space can rent it to a
decentralized network in exchange for a fee paid by those who utilize the space. When
aggregated, the total storage available can easily surpass that of data centers.
One thing that makes DePIN attractive is that instead of an entire infrastructure network
being owned by a single centralized entity, each part of a DePIN is controlled by its
respective owner. This shifts control away from centralized resource monopolies, who
may not be incentivized to expand access; ensures more equitable resource distribution;
and keeps capex and operating costs low.
5
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
But the real advantage of DePINs lies in their ability to support scale. More specifically, it‚Äôs
easier and cheaper to expand a network of small-scale resources than it is to build new
data centers. It makes DePIN-based compute infrastructure, for example, better aligned
to serve the needs of AI growth than traditional models like centralized cloud
infrastructure
DePIN‚Äôs popularity has caught the attention of the wider blockchain and cryptocurrency
industry. Billions of dollars have flowed from investors to DePIN projects, with the top
ones having raised at least $1 billion. In its State of DePIN 2023 report, Messari estimated
the market cap of DePIN companies with liquid tokens to be about $20 billion, but
generating only $15 million in annualized on-chain revenue. (For perspective, Aethir has
already eclipsed US$15 million ARR in its first year). Experts are predicting DePIN to take
an even bigger leap in 2024, with some suggesting that a DePIN project will be the first
decentralized app with a billion users.
All told, the race for AI supremacy and resulting compute shortage point to a concerning
outcome: What will our future look like if only a handful of companies have control of the
way AI develops?
6
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
The Problem
Make no mistake, the demand-driven shortage of compute resources is not short on
consequences. You have the higher prices, longer wait times, greater latency, and
lower-quality chips typically associated with a supply gap. Then there‚Äôs the talent
migration to companies with better access to compute resources. And that‚Äôs not even to
mention the potential environmental impact.
But only one stands to alter the course of humanity: the unfair distribution of outcomes
that stems from a handful of companies controlling a technology as important as AI.
The AI Wealth Gap
The way it stands now, those with the means‚Äîbig tech‚Äîare in control of how AI
develops, not because they are better at it, but because they control the resources.
OpenAI, NVIDIA, Google, Amazon, and Meta aren‚Äôt the ones suffering from chip shortages;
they aren‚Äôt forced to use old hardware or wait in line for access. This privileged position
means they ultimately decide which underlying models get built, how they get trained,
and how much they cost to use. It‚Äôs a true oligarchy scenario in which companies building
the AI product and service layer will have little choice of which models they have access
to.
This scenario has led one commentator to dub those with means as the ‚ÄúGPU Rich‚Äù and
everyone else as the ‚ÄúGPU Poor.‚Äù In the context of compute, we‚Äôre seeing the Rich push
the resource shortage further down the chain towards the Poor. Represented by startups
and well-known AI companies alike, the Poor simply don‚Äôt have the means to create their
own AI outcomes‚Äîdespite having a fair share of the world‚Äôs AI experts. Society is shutting
itself out of a massive avenue of innovation. This is particularly true at the intersection of
AI and gaming, where real-time rendering promises to rapidly evolve AI interaction.
What we‚Äôre effectively witnessing is the creation of an AI wealth gap that is dangerous,
both for the industry and humanity. For one, there are serious ethical concerns around a
handful of companies dominating an industry. We only have to look to social media as a
prime example. Censorship, lobbying, impunity, campaign financing, exploitation, privacy
violations. The list of concerns runs long. Now imagine those same companies in control
of AGI. It‚Äôs not a comforting thought. Even more sinister, there is a belief that big tech will
begin exploiting AGI long before the achievement is made public. It‚Äôs part of the reason
why the US justice department and federal trade commission are probing monopolistic
practices at Microsoft, OpenAI, and NVIDIA.
7
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Secondly, a widening AI wealth gap increases the cost of competition. The further along
we go towards AGI, the costlier it will be for smaller companies to build and train
competing models. Those that do show promise will simply be swallowed up by the Rich
and used for their own benefit.
What we‚Äôre heading towards is an over-centralized AI industry with a handful of
companies acting as gatekeepers to everything from compute resources to talent. It‚Äôs a
blow to the very ideals of democratic capitalism and the best way to guarantee an
unequal distribution of outcomes. We simply can‚Äôt have this if we are going to evolve as a
species. Without urgent action, we risk losing our agency in a technology that will
transform our world like no other in history.
In response, we need to increase the accessibility of AI resources, to give AI companies
and those working at the intersection of AI and other industries the tools to claw control
away from big tech and produce the innovative outcomes that will usher us into a
post-work society. We can do this by leveraging the power of DePINs to create a
distributed network of affordable compute resources accessible by all.
8
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
The Solution
Aethir is best described as distributed cloud compute infrastructure. It aggregates
enterprise-grade GPU chips into a single global network to increase the supply of
on-demand cloud compute resources for the AI, gaming, and virtualized compute sectors.
What this means is that:
1) Enterprise GPU Owners can unlock the revenue potential of their underutilized
GPU chips by becoming their own cloud compute provider.
2) End Users get access to the affordable on-demand compute resources they need
to power their AI training and inferencing workloads, real-time rendering
applications, and other virtualized compute operations.
Scaling Compute On Demand
What differentiates Aethir from other cloud compute infrastructure is its ability to scale to
meet the demands of rapid AI and cloud gaming growth. Its distributed model is designed
to streamline network expansion so that it can deliver the most optimal and affordable
compute resources on demand to wherever they are needed. This is critical for real-time
rendering, in particular, because it can‚Äôt currently be done at scale using today‚Äôs cloud
compute infrastructure. It‚Äôs on this foundation that the next generation of innovative AI
products and cloud-optimized games will be built.
Leveling the Playing Field
Most importantly, Aethir is a direct response to the widening AI wealth gap. By providing
the GPU Poor with access to affordable enterprise-grade compute resources, it has
positioned itself as a force for good that helps balance the distribution of AI outcomes. It
also avoids the geographical and economic favoritism typically associated with other
compute providers. At the same time, it‚Äôs creating new revenue streams for resource
owners who wouldn‚Äôt have had this opportunity otherwise.
Features
Aethir has five defining features that separate it from other cloud compute infrastructure
providers:
9
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Enterprise grade
The demands of AI and cloud gaming require high-quality cloud compute infrastructure.
Aethir focuses on aggregating high-quality GPU resources, such as NVIDIA‚Äôs H100 chips,
from data centers, tech companies, telecom companies, top gaming studios, and crypto
mining companies. This ensures a level of compute quality that end users can rely on,
whether they are startups, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), or large
enterprises.
Low latency
Latency is a core aspect of real-time rendering. High latency makes cloud gaming
impossible, especially at any sort of scale. But this is exactly what happens with today‚Äôs
cloud compute infrastructure. Even if the compute resources are available, they aren‚Äôt
often capable of delivering on these latency requirements unless the end user is
geographically close to the origin of the compute. This puts serious constraints on
real-time rendering innovation.
Consider gaming in Asia. More than half of the world‚Äôs gamers live there, but most are
gaming on low-end devices. This means two things. First, most simply don‚Äôt have access
to the high-end gaming content produced by the biggest gaming companies. Second, the
biggest gaming companies don‚Äôt have access to the majority of Asian gamers.
Cloud gaming technology would unlock a huge amount of value in Asia simply because it
abstracts compute requirements away from low-end devices and allows those devices to
access high-end gaming content. Until now, this technology hasn‚Äôt been deployed
throughout the region due to the cost of scaling cloud compute infrastructure. This is a
problem that DePINs solve. Aethir, with its distributed model, can meet the demands of
cloud gaming in any specific region, providing scalable, low-latency compute to any
gamer that needs it.
Distributed
Centralized compute infrastructure models are simply too slow to keep up with the
demands of AI and real-time rendering. They are built on the premise of buying new chips
to increase supply, something that is difficult amid a demand-driven chip shortage. As
mentioned, they also struggle to meet geographic- and industry-specific requirements.
Aethir is distributed by design. It aggregates existing chips from across the world into a
powerful and responsive network that can meet end users where they are. Scalability
10
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
then becomes a reality because new compute supply can be added without Aethir
needing to purchase any chips.
Affordability
Aside from ethical concerns around control, centralization has another disadvantage: high
cost. Data center operation and company overhead are ultimately reflected in the price
paid by the consumer for compute resources. And with insatiable demand for compute
driving prices ever higher, smaller companies are often completely priced out of the
market.
Aethir‚Äôs distributed network eliminates the costs associated with legacy providers by as
much as 80%. It doesn‚Äôt have to pay to construct and operate data centers, nor does it
carry the same level of company overhead as large corporates. Aethir can, therefore,
achieve superior unit economics, enabling compute providers to compete fairly on price.
This ultimately means affordable on-demand compute resources for all, at scale.
Decentralized ownership
One of the primary benefits of DePINs is that resource owners always retain ownership of
the resources they contribute to the network. In the context of the billions of dollars big
tech makes off ownership of our data, we can begin to understand how important it is to
make decentralized ownership a core pillar of infrastructure networks.
Aethir‚Äôs model guarantees resource ownership by design. Owners have full control over
how often they make their resources available. And provided they meet quality control
standards, they can earn a steady reward stream that accurately reflects the value of
their contribution. What this means is that it‚Äôs now financially viable for a resource
provider to contribute to Aethir and operate as its own AWS-like cloud compute
infrastructure.
11
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
How It Works
On the supply side, the process for resource owners is straightforward. They simply
register their compute resources with the network, have the resource specifications
evaluated and confirmed, and then stake $ATH to be eligible to service requests.
On the demand side, end users submit requests to the network which are matched with
the most appropriate, high-performance resources. For gaming use cases, the end users
are the gamers themselves and are matched to a high-performance resource that
contains their requested gaming experience.
Upon delivery and confirmation of satisfactory request completion, rewards flow from the
compute buyer and the Aethir treasury to the resource owner.
Powering the Future of Gaming
The gaming industry is massive. With more than 3 billion gamers currently and an
estimated half-a-trillion-dollar market value by 2027, it sits at the forefront of innovation.
Two factors holding the industry back are the download size of large online multiplayer
games and the increasingly high consumer hardware requirements. A side effect of
increasing graphics quality, a game like Starfield requires a 125GB download. And that
doesn‚Äôt even include any additional components or the bandwidth required to play the
12
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
game in real-time. In regions with slower internet speeds or data caps, playing games like
this can prove challenging.
Enter real-time rendering. The future of gaming, it allows gamers to play real-time,
photorealistic games directly in the cloud, storage free, without needing to download
them. The problem is that current cloud compute infrastructure can‚Äôt support real-time
rendering at any sort of scale. There just aren‚Äôt enough compute resources available at
any given time, let alone affordable resources with low latency.
Aethir has the answer. It‚Äôs the only cloud compute infrastructure designed specifically to
support real-time rendering at scale for mobile and PC cloud gaming. By providing
affordable, low-latency compute resources at scale, it can serve gamers across
geographies with a seamless experience. With this foundation in place, the next step is
for game studios to begin building for a cloud gaming future rendered in real-time.
Enabling AI Productization
While the underlying AI models are developing exponentially, few companies are looking
at ways to productize AI for the next billion users. Our interactions with today‚Äôs models
are largely confined to text and voice. ChatGPT, Midjourney, among others, feel
impersonal and require complex prompting and fine-tuning to extract the most valuable
output. And despite having so much potential to assist us in our daily lives, AI agents are
even more difficult to set up and derive value from. This isn‚Äôt a roadmap for mass
adoption, but it won‚Äôt be like that for long.
As AI evolves, so too will the ways in which we interact with it. We‚Äôll see AI
avatars‚Äîagents, assistants, and non-playing characters (NPCs)‚Äîrendered in real-time
on our screens. Imagine communicating with an agent as a photorealistic avatar instead
of through a chat box. It will change the way we see the technology, adding a
much-needed human element and enabling more natural communication.
The issue is that this evolution of AI interactivity requires compute infrastructure that is
not yet accessible outside of big tech. Aethir‚Äôs real-time rendering infrastructure has the
solution. By delivering low-latency, enterprise-grade compute at scale, Aethir is the
foundation on which innovators can revolutionize the way we interact with AI models and
enable the kind of innovation that will bring AI truly into everyday life. And once this highly
interactive state is reached, the race for low-latency, real-time rendering compute will be
on.
13
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Leveraging Web3
Web3 is a core component of any DePIN. Without it, building and operating a globally
distributed network of affordable compute resources that can meet the demands of AI
and real-time rendering is nearly impossible. The costs of creating a centralized network,
for one, would be so high that it would defeat the purpose of trying to bridge the AI
wealth gap.
Web3 solutions, on the other hand, are capable of underpinning a DePIN. Blockchain
maximizes the efficiency of resource consumption tracking, smart contracts reduce the
need for large company overhead, and crypto streamlines the transfer of value. There are
also the added benefits of transparency around cost and resource availability and an
assurance that resource owners will get paid for their contributions.
More specifically, Aethir leverages Web3 for two core operations:
Incentivization
Incentives are what allow DePINs to build and scale their networks. Aside from the
revenue generated from resource consumption, there can be rewards for things like
availability (or liveness) and resource quality. And as demand for resources rises, it
continually attracts new resource owners. Web3 makes it possible to pay these
incentives, regardless of the amount, with the DePIN‚Äôs own native token at a fraction of
the cost of traditional payment channels.
Aethir has issued its own native ecosystem token, $ATH, to power its economy. Providers
are rewarded in $ATH for proving their capacity (liveness), delivering resources, and
completing workloads:
‚óè Proof of Capacity (PoC) - The PoC reward is critical to the network because it
rewards early contributors and deters them from taking their resources offline
when there is no demand.
‚óè Proof of Delivery (PoD) - The PoD reward is paid by the Aethir network. A tiered
system has been implemented to ensure higher rewards are paid to owners
providing the highest quality resources.
‚óè Service Fee - The Service Fee is paid by the resource consumer as a price set by
the network and/or resource owner.
14
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
At the same time, a slashing mechanism has been implemented to deter bad actors and
safeguard consumers from supply interruptions. It works by requiring resource owners to
stake $ATH prior to contributing their resources to the network. This stake is ultimately
slashed in case the resource owner does something considered detrimental to the
network, such as taking their resources offline in the middle of processing a request.
Consumption tracking and real-time payments
Blockchain has emerged as the perfect settlement layer for tracking and processing
transactions. In Aethir‚Äôs case, this means all of the resources, orders, deliveries of
compute resources, service fees, and rewards. For example, each Checker node is
represented by an NFT, which enables all operations associated with it to be tracked.
Resource owners can leverage this data to build a transparent track record of availability
and delivery that can be trusted by end users.
Blockchain and crypto have also lowered the barriers to real-time payments. Traditionally,
resource owners had to accrue some minimum of revenue in order to withdraw funds. In
some cases, this could take weeks or months. DePINs, on the other hand, can leverage
blockchain and crypto to stream payments in near real time at virtually no cost. Aethir
uses this feature to build trust with resource owners.
15
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Use Cases
Once companies have access to scalable on-demand compute, the opportunities for
innovation are limitless.
AI Model Training
The simple truth is that AI models aren‚Äôt evolving without a massive scaleup in compute.
In other words, we aren‚Äôt getting to AGI, and we‚Äôre not ensuring a fair distribution of AI
outcomes, unless we can find a way to train AI models at scale. This is exactly what
Aethir‚Äôs cloud infrastructure is designed to do.
AI Inferencing
AI inferencing is the process through which a trained AI model can reason and draw
conclusions from data it has never seen before. Every time ChatGPT is asked a question,
for instance, it must do inferencing. But inferencing requires significant levels of
low-latency compute to respond with the correct outcome within a reasonable amount of
time. Traffic management, self-driving cars, air traffic control, and a host of other
mission-critical applications require the absolute minimum of latency to be viable. It‚Äôs a
level of quality compute infrastructure that few companies have access to.
Aethir‚Äôs distributed cloud compute infrastructure is designed to deliver low-latency
compute to wherever it‚Äôs needed. It can aggregate resources in specific geographic areas
without needing to rely on centralized data centers far from the end user. This ultimately
reduces the wait time for inferencing and enables more complex AI use cases.
Cloud Gaming
Also known as game streaming, cloud gaming is on the precipice of rapid growth. With
entry-level gaming computers running at about $1,000, they are beyond the reach of
hundreds of millions of gamers. Additionally, that many of the most popular mobile games
require high-end mobile devices is equally exclusionary. One alternative is to rent time at
an internet cafe where gaming computers are available, but costs can add up quickly over
time and, in most markets, these businesses are decreasing in their availability.
Cloud gaming makes high-end gaming accessible. Game studios no longer have to worry
about designing for low-end devices. They can simply abstract the resource-intensive
16
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
operations to the cloud while allowing users to play on whatever device they can afford.
And provided low-latency is ensured, the experience is just like playing a game on a
high-end local device. Aethir makes this possible.
Cloud Phone
With enough compute, it‚Äôs possible to transform a user's mobile phone into a
cloud-powered, infinitely replicable, super-powered mobile device. By downloading and
installing an app, users can generate and access cloud phone instances that offload
resource-heavy applications to the cloud. Advanced photo-editing software or real-time
games, which typically require high-end hardware, are suddenly possible for even the
lowest end of the smartphone market.
Aside from significantly enhancing device performance, battery life, and efficiency, the
Cloud Phone unlocks incompatible applications that Google Play or the App Store restrict
access to due to owning old or lower-end hardware. Imagine installing a cloud phone
application on a low-end smartphone and, upon opening the app, you are able to use the
equivalent of the latest, high-end smartphone device.
AI Productization
As AI models become smarter and more useful, the AI product market is likely to
experience rapid expansion. For example, we‚Äôll see products such as remote worker
agents that can be onboarded directly to your company‚Äôs Slack channel and contribute to
team meetings and Zoom calls. Having already been trained on your company history and
processes, it‚Äôs just like having a new employee with Ph.D-level knowledge.
The level of inferencing, and real-time rendering for Zoom calls, needed to reach this level
of integration and performance requires a lot of compute. Current infrastructure is simply
not designed for this type of compute requirement. Only Aethir is optimized for
low-latency real-time rendering in such a way that large scale, real-time rendered AI
interactions are possible.
17
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
The Technology
The Aethir stack comprises five core components:
‚óè Resource owners - The GPU chip owners who provide the actual compute
resources to the network for use in Containers.
‚óè Aethir Network - Comprises Containers, Checkers, and Indexers which house the
compute resources, provide quality assurance, and facilitate matching based on
end user requirements.
‚óè Compute buyers and gamers - Consumes Aethir network compute resources on
demand, whether for AI training and inferencing or gaming.
‚óè Treasury - Holds all staked $ATH and pays out all $ATH rewards and fees.
‚óè Settlement layer - Aethir leverages blockchain technology as its settlement layer
to record transactions and support scalability, efficiency, and $ATH for incentives.
18
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Aethir Network Roles
Within the Aethir network itself, there are three roles that ensure the availability,
suitability, and quality of compute resources:
Container
The Container is where the actual utilization of the compute resources takes place. It acts
as a virtual endpoint for execution and/or rendering and ensures that the cloud
experience is immediate and responsive‚Äîa "zero lag" experience.
Selection
The selection process differs depending on the type of compute required:
‚óè AI compute customers - Containers are selected by the customer based on its
performance requirements.
‚óè Gaming compute customers - Containers are chosen based on their ability to
provide the highest quality of service for the lowest possible cost. Capability to
deliver the best possible gaming experience‚Äîfactors such as frame rate, low
latency and resolution‚Äîare considered.
Staking
The staking mechanism is a critical component of any DePIN because it incentivizes good
behavior and penalizes bad behavior. It ensures that participants are aligned with the
platform's objectives and motivated to provide optimal services. New node operators are
required to stake $ATH before they can contribute resources to a Container. If a node
operator is found deviating from quality control standards or disrupting the network, it‚Äôs at
risk of having its stake slashed.
Rewards
Containers are rewarded in two different ways:
‚óè Readiness - Containers receive compensation for maintaining a state of high
readiness and for providing standby services, e.g., PoC reward.
‚óè Service - Additional rewards are given for the compute resources actively used by
the end user, e.g., PoD and Service Fee rewards.
19
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Aethir Edge
The Aethir Edge is a device that functions as a standardized container node. Upon
purchase, owners can use it to contribute their consumer-grade compute resources to
the Aethir network in exchange for rewards.
In the majority of cases, consumer compute hardware is not suitable for use within
enterprise-grade compute infrastructure. The range of devices is simply too broad. Aethir
Edge solves this problem. Consumer-grade resource owners can contribute standardized,
high-performance container nodes directly to the Aethir network, allowing Aethir to push
enterprise workloads to them. For the first time, consumer compute infrastructure is being
homogenized and unlocked for the demands of AI and cloud gaming.
Checker
The Checker‚Äôs primary responsibility is to ensure the integrity and performance of
Containers within the network. It does this by running tests at key stages of the
Container‚Äôs lifecycle.
Checking schedule
Checks are made at three key stages:
‚óè At registration - An initial check is done when a Container applies for registration
on the Aethir network to confirm specifications. Containers that pass this check
are successfully registered.
‚óè In standby state - Random checks are conducted on Containers in standby to
ensure availability. These checks influence the container‚Äôs scheduling opportunities
and priority by the Indexer.
‚óè During delivery state - Service data is collected and assessed to judge the actual
service status. The results determine whether penalties for subpar service quality
need to be levied.
Checking methods
The Checker runs its tests in two different ways:
‚óè Performance parameters - Directly reading Container performance data.
‚óè Simulation testing - Acting as a compute buyer to test resource consumption and
analyze interactions, ensuring compliance with claimed specifications.
20
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Proof of Capacity (Liveness)
Recognizing and rewarding the readiness of node operators is paramount. Even when
there's a dormant phase without active compute contribution, Aethir recognizes and
rewards the availability of node operators. This mechanism promises a baseline level of
compute so that end users always get the resources they need, even during demand
spikes. Proof of Capacity checks are made by Checkers every 15 minutes.
Proof of Delivery
Container performance is closely monitored to ensure quality. Checkers make sure that
service requests are completed according to Aethir‚Äôs quality standards. This is an
essential service that results in rewards and fees being paid to the resource owner or its
stake being slashed. It also has an impact on future scheduling possibilities.
Indexer
Where required, the Indexer matches end users with suitable Containers based on their
requirements. For gaming use cases, the goal is to deliver an ‚Äúinstant play‚Äù experience so
that the transition from a gamer‚Äôs on-screen request to its actual delivery occurs in the
shortest possible time.
Selection
When delivering gaming services, an Indexer is chosen at random for each service
request to maintain decentralization. This approach helps mitigate potential fraud and
minimizes signaling delays due to protocol complexity.
Matching criteria
When matching Containers with service requests, Indexers first consider the Container‚Äôs
status, readiness, latency, specifications, and service fee. Actual selection is then based
on a combination of lowest service fee, best experience, and overall ranking in the
network‚Äôs evaluation index.
21
Aethir Whitepaper 2024 v1.0
Conclusion
In the race to AGI and its promise of unprecedented control, we can‚Äôt lose sight of the fact
that a technology as important as AI needs to work for the benefit of humanity, not for
that of a privileged few. This is, unfortunately, not the direction in which we‚Äôre heading.
The demand-driven GPU shortage, and the resulting AI wealth gap, is threatening to skew
the distribution of AI outcomes heavily in favor of those that can stockpile the most chips.
It presents the very real risk that the development of AI will be driven mainly by a handful
of companies that already control most of our online experience.
But AI isn‚Äôt the only technology affected by the GPU shortage. Half a billion gamers in
Asia alone don‚Äôt have access to high-end gaming content because they game on low-end
devices. The very thought of cloud gaming in real-time is but a pipe dream. That would
change if gaming studios could ensure that gamers had access to the low-latency
compute resources needed to power cloud gaming.
What we need in this critical moment is to guarantee fair access to the one resource that
will have the biggest impact on the future of AI and gaming: compute.
This is at the heart of Aethir‚Äôs mission. By building a globally distributed cloud compute
infrastructure network, it has positioned itself as the foundation on which AI and gaming
innovation can be unleashed for the benefit of humanity.

Executive Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the single most important technology we‚Äôve ever seen. But what only a relative few can see is the imminent transformation of life as we know it once artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved‚Äîas soon as 2027, by some accounts. Whoever is first to roll it out at scale will be granted an unprecedented level of control over the future of humanity.

The race to AGI has created a thirst for compute so insatiable that there is no conceivable scenario where demand can be met. This has sent big tech, governments, and anyone else with the resources scrambling to secure enough GPU chips, spending tens of billions in the process. For those without the resources, they are stuck relying on expensive cloud compute providers.

Decentralized physical infrastructure networks, or DePINs have emerged as an alternative. As distributed networks of aggregated small-scale infrastructure, they are designed to support rapid scale. In the compute context, this means GPU chips owned by data centers, tech companies, telecom companies, top gaming studios, and crypto mining companies

As we move towards AGI, we are confronted with a problem that stands to alter the course of humanity if left unchecked: the unfair distribution of outcomes that stems from a handful of companies controlling a technology as important as AI. The widening AI wealth gap between the GPU Rich and GPU Poor is tilting the balance heavily in favor of big tech.

In response, we need to increase the accessibility of on-demand compute so that AI companies can claw control away from big tech and produce the innovative outcomes that will ensure AI is developed for the good of humanity. The only way to do this is by leveraging the power of DePINs to create a distributed network of affordable compute resources accessible by all.

Aethir has built this distributed network. It aggregates enterprise-grade GPU chips into a single global network that increases the supply of on-demand cloud compute resources for the AI, gaming, and virtualized compute sectors. Enterprise GPU owners can unlock the revenue potential of their underutilized GPU chips, while end users get access to the affordable on-demand compute resources they need to power their AI training and inferencing workloads, real-time rendering applications, and other virtualized compute operations.

What differentiates Aethir from other cloud compute infrastructure is its ability to scale to meet the demands of rapid AI and cloud gaming growth. Its distributed model is designed to streamline network expansion so that it can deliver the most optimal and affordable compute resources on demand to wherever they are needed. Five key features make this possible:

Enterprise-grade compute resources

Low latency to support real-time rendering and AI inferencing use cases

A distributed model that can scale much faster than its centralized counterpart

Superior unit economics that make on-demand compute resources affordable

Decentralized ownership that allows resource owners to retain control

Aethir is powering the future of gaming. It‚Äôs the only cloud compute infrastructure designed specifically to support real-time rendering at scale for mobile and PC cloud gaming. It can serve gamers across geographies with a seamless, low-latency experience without the need for high-end hardware.

It‚Äôs also enabling the evolution of AI interaction, through a combination of real-time rendering and AI inferencing that requires compute infrastructure not yet accessible outside of big tech. Aethir‚Äôs real-time rendering infrastructure is the foundation on which innovators can revolutionize the way we interact with AI models and enable the kind of innovation that will bring AI truly into everyday life.

As a DePIN, Aethir leverages Web3 to enable incentivization and consumption tracking. Resource owners are rewarded in Aethir‚Äôs native $ATH token for providing resources to the network, while blockchain is used to track resource consumption by end users and facilitate the transfer of rewards.

Aethir‚Äôs cloud compute infrastructure network supports a number of critical use cases, including AI model training, AI inferencing, cloud gaming, cloud phone, and AI productization. In each case, its capability for scalable, affordable, low-latency compute can keep up with the demands of innovation in these areas.

The network consists of 3 core roles: Container, Checker, and Indexer. Containers, including the Aethir Edge, are where the actual utilization of the compute resources takes place. Checkers ensure the integrity and performance of the Containers. Where required, Indexers match end users with suitable Containers based on end-user requirements. Together, they ensure that Aethir can deliver the highest-quality compute to support rapid AI and cloud gaming growth.

Key Features
Aethir has five defining features that separate it from other cloud compute infrastructure providers:

Enterprise grade
The demands of AI and cloud gaming require high-quality cloud compute infrastructure. Aethir focuses on aggregating high-quality GPU resources, such as NVIDIA‚Äôs H100 chips, from data centers, tech companies, telecom companies, top gaming studios, and crypto mining companies. This ensures a level of compute quality that end users can rely on, whether they are startups, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), or large enterprises.

Low latency
Latency is a core aspect of real-time rendering. High latency makes cloud gaming impossible, especially at any sort of scale. But this is exactly what happens with today‚Äôs cloud compute infrastructure. Even if the compute resources are available, they aren‚Äôt often capable of delivering on these latency requirements unless the end user is geographically close to the origin of the compute. This puts serious constraints on real-time rendering innovation.

Consider gaming in Asia. More than half of the world‚Äôs gamers live there, but most are gaming on low-end devices. This means two things. First, most simply don‚Äôt have access to the high-end gaming content produced by the biggest gaming companies. Second, the biggest gaming companies don‚Äôt have access to the majority of Asian gamers.

Cloud gaming technology would unlock a huge amount of value in Asia simply because it abstracts compute requirements away from low-end devices and allows those devices to access high-end gaming content. Until now, this technology hasn‚Äôt been deployed throughout the region due to the cost of scaling cloud compute infrastructure. This is a problem that DePINs solve. Aethir, with its distributed model, can meet the demands of cloud gaming in any specific region, providing scalable, low-latency compute to any gamer that needs it.

Distributed
Centralized compute infrastructure models are simply too slow to keep up with the demands of AI and real-time rendering. They are built on the premise of buying new chips to increase supply, something that is difficult amid a demand-driven chip shortage. As mentioned, they also struggle to meet geographic- and industry-specific requirements.

Aethir is distributed by design. It aggregates existing chips from across the world into a powerful and responsive network that can meet end users where they are. Scalability then becomes a reality because new compute supply can be added without Aethir needing to purchase any chips.

Affordability
Aside from ethical concerns around control, centralization has another disadvantage: high cost. Data center operation and company overhead are ultimately reflected in the price paid by the consumer for compute resources. And with insatiable demand for compute driving prices ever higher, smaller companies are often completely priced out of the market.

Aethir‚Äôs distributed network eliminates the costs associated with legacy providers by as much as 80%. It doesn‚Äôt have to pay to construct and operate data centers, nor does it carry the same level of company overhead as large corporates. Aethir can, therefore, achieve superior unit economics, enabling compute providers to compete fairly on price. This ultimately means affordable on-demand compute resources for all, at scale.

Decentralized ownership
One of the primary benefits of DePINs is that resource owners always retain ownership of the resources they contribute to the network. In the context of the billions of dollars big tech makes off ownership of our data, we can begin to understand how important it is to make decentralized ownership a core pillar of infrastructure networks.

Aethir‚Äôs model guarantees resource ownership by design. Owners have full control over how often they make their resources available. And provided they meet quality control standards, they can earn a steady reward stream that accurately reflects the value of their contribution. What this means is that it‚Äôs now financially viable for a resource provider to contribute to Aethir and operate as its own AWS-like cloud compute infrastructure.


Aethir Token ($ATH)
The Aethir Token ($ATH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Aethir network. It is a core component of the Aethir ecosystem, serving as the primary medium of exchange for transactions within the network.

Key Functions of ATH
Facilitating Payments - $ATH is used to pay for various services on the Aethir network, such as renting GPU resources for AI applications, cloud gaming, and other computational tasks.

Governance - $ATH holders have the right to participate in the governance of the Aethir network by voting on proposals and decisions that affect the future of the platform.

Staking - Users can stake their $ATH tokens to support the security and operation of the network, and in return, they earn rewards in the form of additional $ATH tokens.

Security and Quality Assurance - $ATH is used to incentivize participants in the network to maintain the security and quality of the services provided.

Settlement layer - Aethir leverages blockchain technology as its settlement layer to record transactions and support scalability, efficiency, and $ATH for incentives.

The Container
Fundamental to the Aethir network, the Container is where the actual use of the cloud takes place. It acts as a virtual endpoint, executing and rendering the application (e.g., rendering the game for the player). The Container's purpose is to ensure that the cloud experience is immediate and responsive, offering a "zero lag" experience. This is achieved by shifting the workload from the local device to the Container (e.g., shifting all game execution and command processing).‚ÄØ 

Operational Considerations
Container Status: Must always be in a ready state, prepared for immediate activation upon consumer request.‚ÄØ 

Application Deployment: Each Container should have the application or services pre-installed and configured to allow quick access and startup.‚ÄØ 

Processing Capability: Containers need to meet specific processing and graphical requirements to handle the applications or services without performance issues.‚ÄØ 

Network Efficiency: Must possess the bandwidth and network infrastructure to support high-speed data transfer and low-latency interactions.‚ÄØ 

Selection Process‚ÄØ 
Performance-Based: Containers are selected based on their ability to provide the highest quality of service with the lowest possible latency and cost.‚ÄØ 

Experience Optimization: Containers are assessed for their capability to deliver the best possible consumer or enterprise application experience, considering factors such as frame rate and resolution.‚ÄØ 

Resource Provisioning 
Rewards for Readiness: Containers receive compensation for maintaining a state of high readiness and for providing standby services.‚ÄØ 

Incentives for Service: Additional rewards are given for the actual runtime during which Containers are actively used by consumers.‚ÄØ 

Quality Assurance 
Performance Validation: A Container's performance is regularly checked to ensure it continues to meet the network's standards.‚ÄØ 

Service Feedback: The actual user experience is monitored and used to adjust the priority and selection of Containers in the future. 

Containers States
Ready to Configure: When a Container is new, it's like it's waiting for its instructions. This is the time when it's set up with the right settings and information. 

Waiting for Check-Up: Once set up, the Container waits for a Checker to make sure everything is in order. 

Checked and Ready: If the Checker gives a thumbs up, the Container is all set to be used in the network. 

Need Rechecking: If something's not right, the Container goes back for another check-up. 

Connected and Healthy: A Container needs to show it's well-connected and functioning correctly. This is like a regular heartbeat, showing it's alive and kicking. 

Locked for Maintenance: Sometimes, a Container needs a tune-up or an upgrade. During this time, it's not available for use. 

Quality Control: We always monitor the quality of a Container's work. If it's not up to the mark, it needs to be checked and fixed. 

Dashboard
Ready for Action: Containers that have passed checks and are healthy. 

Busy Working: Containers currently in the middle of a task. 

Taking a Break: Containers that are offline or not in a healthy state. 

Getting Set Up: Containers being prepared for action. 

Billing and Usage
Active Use: Containers that are online, healthy, and busy with tasks. 

On Standby: Containers that are ready and waiting but not currently busy. 

Fee Adjustments: In certain situations, like if a Container isn't performing well or is offline when it shouldn't be, there could be fee adjustments. 


Staking and Rewards
Staking
The staking mechanism is a critical component of any DePIN because it incentivizes good behavior and penalizes bad behavior. It ensures that participants are aligned with the platform's objectives and motivated to provide optimal services. New node operators are required to stake $ATH before they can contribute resources to a Container. If a node operator is found deviating from quality control standards or disrupting the network, it‚Äôs at risk of having its stake slashed.

Rewards
Containers are rewarded in two different ways:

Readiness - Containers receive compensation for maintaining a state of high readiness and for providing standby services, e.g., PoC reward.‚ÄØ 

Service - Additional rewards are given for the compute resources actively used by the end user, e.g., PoD and Service Fee rewards.


The Checker
The Checker ensures the integrity and performance of Containers within the Aethir network. Verifying container specifications as provided by the Container Providers is essential to maintain the network's Quality of Service (QoS).‚ÄØ 

Check Processes:‚ÄØ 

At Registration: When a container is registered on the Aethir network.‚ÄØ 

In Standby State: Random checks are conducted on containers in standby.‚ÄØ 

During Rendering State: Service information is collected and assessed to judge the actual service status.‚ÄØ 

Outcome of Checks:‚ÄØ 

Registration Validation: Confirms container specifications and successful registration.‚ÄØ 

Scheduling Influence: Affects the container's scheduling opportunity and priority by the Indexer.‚ÄØ 

Quality Control: Determines penalties for subpar service quality.‚ÄØ 

Checking Methods:‚ÄØ 

Performance Parameters: Direct reading of container's performance data.‚ÄØ 

Simulation Testing: Acting as a consumer to test applications and analyze interactions, ensuring compliance with claimed specifications.‚ÄØ 

Checker Deployment: Initially deployed by the Aethir, with plans for gradual decentralization.‚ÄØ 

Proof of Capacity and Delivery
Proof of Capacity (Liveness)
Recognizing and rewarding the readiness of node operators is paramount. Even when there's a dormant phase without active compute contribution, Aethir recognizes and rewards the availability of node operators. This mechanism promises a baseline level of compute so that end users always get the resources they need, even during demand spikes. Proof of Capacity checks are made by Checkers every 15 minutes.

Proof of Delivery
Container performance is closely monitored to ensure quality. Checkers make sure that service requests are completed according to Aethir‚Äôs quality standards. This is an essential service that results in rewards and fees being paid to the resource owner or its stake being slashed. It also has an impact on future scheduling possibilities.

The Indexer
Central to Aethir‚Äôs network, the Indexer matches consumers with suitable Containers, ensuring a swift launch of cloud-based apps & services. The goal is to deliver a ‚Äúsecond on‚Äù service - the transition from a consumer‚Äôs request to the actual delivery (e.g., a player making a request to a game screen) should occur in the shortest possible time. This requires succinct signaling and efficient scheduling.‚ÄØ

Scheduling Considerations:‚ÄØ 

Container Status: Must be in Standby state.‚ÄØ 

Service Deployment: The cloud services should be pre-installed in the container.‚ÄØ 

Resource Requirements: The container‚Äôs specifications must meet the hardware and network demands of the cloud services.‚ÄØ 

Latency: The distance between the container and the consumer or enterprise should fall within acceptable latency limits.‚ÄØ 

Service Fee: The container‚Äôs fee should not exceed the developer's budget.‚ÄØ 

Selection Criteria: The Indexer prioritizes containers based on lowest service fee, best experience, or the best overall evaluation index.‚ÄØ 

Decentralization and Fraud Prevention: To maintain decentralization and enhance user experience, Indexers are selected randomly. This approach helps mitigate potential fraud risks and minimizes signaling delays due to protocol complexity.‚ÄØ 

Session Dynamics
A session, lasting 15 minutes, is the primary unit of service. Think of it as booking a short service time-slot. The cost of each session changes depending on how busy the network is. 

Service Modes
The network operates in two modes:

Service Modes: The network operates in two modes: 

Wholesale: Like bulk buying, where services are pre-booked at a set price.

Service Fees
This is the cost paid by developers to the containers for the services. It‚Äôs a bit like a bidding system where the price can go up or down based on demand.

ATH Token‚Äôs Utility & Purpose
The ATH token, native to Aethir, plays a multifunctional role in the ecosystem:

Transactional Utility:

Primarily, ATH acts as the standard medium of exchange within Aethir. Demand-side participants looking to purchase processing power engage with node operators, compensating them in ATH for their computing power. This reflects within Aethir‚Äôs three main business models: AI applications, cloud compute, and virtualized compute.

Diversified Application:

Beyond its application in AI applications, virtualized compute, and cloud gaming, ATH finds use as the ecosystem grows. With the introduction of merge mining and integrated marketplaces, the ATH token will continue to grow in use case as the preferred means of transaction, showcasing its adaptability, relevance and future integrations, potentially giving way to a plethora of different use cases that ATH can be incorporated into.

Governance and Participation:

Furthermore, as Aethir moves towards establishing its DAO, the ATH token takes on an additional role in governance. Token holders are empowered to propose, discuss, and vote on platform changes, ensuring that Aethir maintains its decentralized ethos.

Staking:

New node operators wishing to contribute to the Aethir ecosystem are required to stake ATH tokens as an initial commitment. This staking mechanism ensures that participants are economically aligned with the platform's objectives. In addition to serving as a symbol of commitment, the staked ATH tokens function as a protective measure against potential misconduct. As these tokens act as collateral should any node operator engage in actions that deviate from the platform's standards or exhibit any form of malpractice, they face the risk of having a portion or all of their staked ATH tokens slashed.

Mining Rewards
Aethir's choice to dedicate large amount of Total Token Supply (TTS) to mining rewards is a strategic play to fortify its ecosystem. Highlighting a clear recognition of the value of its contributors.

Here‚Äôs why this chunk of allocation matters:

Backing Node Operators: Node operators are the backbone of Aethir, supplying the necessary computing power. The incentive fund is designed to draw resource providers in and keep them committed.

Upholding Container Standards: Aethir relies on its containers to provide computing resources. By incentivizing them properly, Aethir attracts the most efficient resource providers.

In short, the mining rewards isn't just an allocation; it's an investment. Aethir is betting big on its community, ensuring the platform isn‚Äôt just viable today but remains strong in the future.

The mining rewards is strategically divided into:

Proof of Rendering Work: Token incentives are provided to node operators as an additional reward for completing computing tasks within the ecosystem. This encourages supply-side entities to join Aethir‚Äôs ecosystem and provide valuable processing and computing work. Proof of Rendering Work is exclusively distributed to containers upon completing computing tasks.

Proof of Capacity: Compute Providers earn Proof of Rendering Capacity for demonstrating readiness to provide compute services. Even in the absence of active work, providers receive rewards to incentivize onboarding onto the ecosystem, thus mitigating participation risks.

Mining Reward Emissions
With the importance of Mining Rewards for ecosystem participants discussed beforehand, the emissions of mining rewards is critical in order to balance onboarding of resource providers, upholding container standards, and ensuring long-term sustainability of rewards. This is to ensure that despite the frontloading of rewards, by utilising a decay function for bootstrapping, participants and resource providers who enter Aethir‚Äôs ecosystem at a latter stage are not punished, but still heavily incentivized to enter and provide towards the ecosystem.

More in-depth information in regards to the exact mining reward emissions and the decay function will be released in the near future.

What is a Checker Node
A Checker Node is one of the three fundamental components of the Aethir Network backend infrastructure:

Containers: Fundamental to the Aethir network, the Container is where the actual use of the cloud takes place. It acts as a virtual endpoint, executing and rendering the application (e.g., rendering the game for a player, executing an inference task for an AI consumer, powering a virtual phone). The Container's purpose is to ensure that the cloud experience is immediate and responsive, offering a "zero lag" experience. This is achieved by shifting the workload from the local device to the Container (e.g., shifting all game execution and command processing).

Checkers: The Checker ensures the integrity and performance of Containers within the Aethir network. Verifying container specifications as provided by the Container Providers is essential to maintain the network's Quality of Service (QoS).

Indexers: Core to Aethir‚Äôs network, the Indexer matches consumers with suitable Containers, ensuring a swift launch of cloud-based apps & services. The goal is to deliver a ‚Äúsecond on‚Äù service - the transition from a consumer‚Äôs request to the actual delivery (e.g. a player making a request to a game screen) should occur in the shortest possible time. This requires succinct signaling and efficient scheduling.

What is a Checker Node Client
A Checker Node Client is the software you can download and install on your machine, to run a Checker Node. You can find more information on how to run a Checker Node Client and the minimum hardware requirements here.


Delegation
Delegation is the process of authorizing Checker Node Client to earn rewards for your Checker Node License (NFT).

As an NFT owner, you can choose which Checker Node Client to delegate to via your Portal (coming soon!). If you are running the node yourself, you can find your burner wallet address inside the Checker Node Client. It is important to verify that you are delegating to the correct wallet address, so that you are not penalized for invalid calculations or downtime. You can choose to un-delegate or re-delegate anytime through your Portal.

As a node runner, you can choose to accept or reject a delegation request inside the Checker Client. You can also choose to end a delegation at any point of time. It is important to verify that you are accepting delegation from the correct owner wallet, else you‚Äôd be earning rewards for the wrong person.

Claim rewards
$vATH tokens vest into $ATH in 120 days after you choose to claim. If an Owner choose to withdraw early (30 days) and skips the vesting period, a 75% penalty is applied to the conversion, and owner loses eligibility for bonus rewards. After 120 days, the default vesting period will be 180 days. There is a 10 $ATH minimum requirement for withdraw.

You can claim and withdraw from the Owner Portal.

Node Purchase Caps
The lowest tiers have low caps so that the community can access Aethir nodes at lower prices. This is Aethir‚Äôs way of contributing to the network‚Äôs decentralization and ensuring a fairer distribution of node licenses.

The lowest price tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have caps of 5, 10, 15, and 30 nodes per buyer to ensure that most community members can access Aethir nodes at lower prices. 

Tiers 5 and 6 have a cap of 50 and 100 nodes.

Tiers 7-10 have a cap of 200 nodes per buyer. 

Tiers 11-18 have a cap of 500 nodes per buyer.

FAQ


MINING

Q: What is the total token supply allocated to Edge devices?
23% of the total $ATH supply, which is 9.66 billion tokens, is allocated to Edge devices.

Q: When can I start mining tokens?
$ATH token mining will start after Aethir Edge‚Äôs app launch on June 20th (Android app only). The iOS app will be available in due course.  

Q: Is staking required to activate Edge devices?
Yes, staking is required to activate Edge devices. The first 20,000 devices purchased before June 12th will receive $ATH airdrop that includes a portion of the tokens needed for the staking requirement. Please refer to our Edge Emission schedule for more details about staking requirements.  

Q: Where can I find the mining emission schedule?
Please check out the Edge Emission schedule.  

Q: How is the 23% token supply allocated to Edge devices distributed over time?
The 23% token supply is distributed gradually over approximately 10 years according to the following schedule:
Year 1: 40% of the total Edge allocation (9.2% of total supply)
Year 2: 24.12% of the total Edge allocation (5.5476% of total supply)
Year 3: 14.54% of the total Edge allocation (3.3452% of total supply)
Year 4: 8.77% of the total Edge allocation (2.0172% of total supply)
Year 5: 5.29% of the total Edge allocation (1.2163% of total supply)

The amount distributed reduces each year for 10 years until the full 23% Edge supply is allocated. The percentages shown are the portion of the total Edge supply, with the equivalent percentage of total supply in brackets.

Q: How are devices rewarded after the initial 23% supply is mined?
Once the initial 23% token supply reserved for Edge mining is fully distributed, Edge devices will continue generating revenue by providing services on the Aethir network.

Companies utilizing Aethir's infrastructure for AI, gaming, cloud phone services, etc will pay service fees for access to the network resources. Of these fees, 80% will be distributed as rewards to Edge device operators who are providing the infrastructure and processing power.
The remaining 20% of fees will go to the Aethir DAO. This sustainable fee-based model allows Edge devices to keep earning rewards long-term after the 23% mining supply depletes.

Q: Does emission allocated to edge miners depend on how many edges will be sold?
Yes it does. Please see the Edge Emission schedule for more information.

Q: Do you have an earnings calculator? Before making a decision on purchasing one, people will want to model their earnings vs. power usage, etc.
No, we do not have an earnings calculator.

Q: The total supply of $ATH is higher for Edge Nodes than Checkers. How do the emission schedules compare?
Please check out the Edge Emission schedule.



DEVICE

Q: Can I run multiple Edges in one household?
Yes, as long as there is sufficient broadband connectivity in your household.

Q: Can one Edge be bound to multiple wallets?
No, each Edge can only be bound to one wallet. However, one wallet can bind with multiple edge devices.

Q: What are the minimum network requirements for Edge?
Network bandwidth requirements for uplink & downlink are 20 Mbps.

Q: What is the power consumption (wattage) of the Aethir Edge device?
The maximum power consumption (wattage) of the Aethir Edge device is 48 watts.
This is based on the device's power adapter specification of 12V 4A. 
Using the formula:
Voltage (Volts) x Current (Amps) = Power (Watts) 
12V x 4A = 48 watts

Q: What is the noise level of Edge?
It normally operates quieter than a typical home computer, ensuring a quiet environment for your home or office. 

Q: What are the specifications of Edge?
Please check out our Specs sheet. For more product information, you can refer to our Overview  document.

Q: How do you set it up?
Connect the adapter to a power source. If using a wired connection, connect one end of the Ethernet cable to the device and the other to your network port. 

Q: How do you operate Edge? Is it compatible with iOS or Android? Do I need a phone to operate it?
You can find full operating instructions in our User Manual. Our mobile app works with both Android (will go live on June 20th) and iOS (coming soon), and lets you monitor your ATH earnings and operational status of the device.

Q: Was the Edge called something else in previous documentation, e.g., container/indexer?
No, it was not.

Q: In the Edge product summary document, it mentions 'leveraging underutilized broadband.' What does this mean?   
If your home internet speed is faster than needed for your normal use, your Aethir Edge device can utilize the excess bandwidth to power applications (AI, Gaming, AR/VR, real-time streaming etc.). You‚Äôll be then rewarded with $ATH tokens.

FAQ
1. How to stake?
To stake, wrap your ATH into veATH and stATH, stake your veATH for staking rewards. Usecases for stATH, will be released soon.

2. What is the minimum/maximum staking period?
Minimum period: 1 week.
Maximum period: 4 years.
The duration of staking must be in whole weeks.

3. When does staking start and end?
Staking starts after you click the stake button and sign the transaction. The week counts from every Thursday at 00:00:00 UTC and ends the following Wednesday at 23:59:59 UTC. For example, if Alice stakes on Tuesday for 1 week, her staking will end the following Wednesday at 23:59:59 UTC (total 8+ days).

4. When can I end my stake and withdraw my staked tokens?
You can withdraw your staked tokens only after the staking period ends.

5. How are rewards distributed?
Rewards are distributed among users weekly, based on the amount of veATH locked, and the duration of veATH locked. This is how ‚ÄúAPR‚Äù is calculated. Users will also earn additional tokens from Aethir ecosystem partners, calculated in the same way as ATH rewards.

6. When can I claim rewards?
Participants can claim rewards every Thursday, one week after staking begins. For example, if Bob stakes his tokens on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, he will be able to claim rewards starting from Thursday, July 11, 2024.

7. How do the amount and duration of staking affect rewards?
The amount and duration of staking determine each user's reward power each week. The higher the reward power, the more rewards the user is entitled to. The more a user stakes and the longer the staking period, the higher the user's reward power.

8. An example of how rewards are calculated.
Suppose Alice stakes 100 tokens for 2 weeks, and Bob stakes 100 tokens for 4 weeks. Each week, the reward pool contains 1000 tokens. Bob's reward power will be twice that of Alice's because he chose a staking period twice as long. Thus, Bob will receive twice the rewards each week compared to Alice. Starting from the third week, Bob will receive all the rewards since he is the only staker left.

9. How can I increase my reward power to receive more weekly tokens?
To increase your reward power, you can stake more ATH and/or extend the duration of your staking period.
