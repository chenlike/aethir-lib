Technical Foundations of APhone
Cloud Computing Foundations

Cloud computing centralizes on simplifying complex infrastructure into manageable services using data centers with extensive server farms, ensuring robustness, scalability, and high availability. It emphasizes dynamic resource allocation and scalability, adjusting resources in real-time according to demand, maximizing efficiency and reducing waste.

Virtualization Technology

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual replicas of physical elements like computer hardware, storage devices, and network resources, using software to simulate hardware and establish virtual systems.


Virtualization Model
Containers and Portability

Containers quickly start by utilizing the host's system kernel, eliminating the boot time and resource usage typical of virtual machine start-ups, allowing container instances to launch in seconds. They offer portability by encapsulating the entire runtime environment of a cloud instance, including the application, its dependencies, class libraries, binaries, and configuration files in a container image, ensuring robust and reliable application transfer across different environments.

Hypervisors and Containers

Hypervisor: A software layer that allows multiple operating systems to share a single hardware host. Each operating system appears to have the host's processor, memory, and other resources all to itself. The hypervisor controls the host processor and resources, distributing them as needed.

Type 1 Hypervisors: Run directly on the host's hardware.

Type 2 Hypervisors: Run on a conventional operating system.

Containers: Unlike VMs (virtual machines), which virtualize the entire system, containers virtualize only the operating system. They are isolated, but share the OS kernel and, where appropriate, binaries and libraries.

GPU Hardware Encoder Technology

GPU hardware encoder: In the Aethir ARM server, GPUs are integrated on the server board to achieve hard video encoding and decoding capabilities


Combination of hardware and software encoding technology: Specially designed for the integration of software and hardware in cloud mobile scenarios, it uses unique video streaming management technology and uses the intra-frame compression and inter-frame compression algorithms of the H.264/H.265 protocol to encode video data into a smaller video stream, which not only has excellent performance, but also consumes very little CPU resources.

Excellent performance: The video resolution supports 1080*1920; Video frame rate> 60FPS (Frame Per Second); Video bitrate > 8192Kbps (Kilobits Per Second)

Network Transmission

Advanced Data Transfer Techniques:

Data Compression: Utilizing algorithms to reduce the size of data packets transmitted between cloud servers and clients.

Protocol Optimization: Choosing efficient protocols (like TCP/IP, HTTP/2) to enhance data transmission speeds and reliability.

Latency Reduction Strategies:

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Distribute content closer to users to minimize latency.

Edge Computing: Processes data at the edge of the network, closer to where it's being generated, reducing the need to send data back and forth to the cloud.

User Interface

Client-Side Technologies: Developing user interfaces for cloud mobile services requires an understanding of various client-side technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for web applications, as well as platform-specific languages for native mobile apps (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android).

Responsive and Adaptive Design:

Ensuring that applications are responsive to different screen sizes and orientations is crucial for user experience.

Employing adaptive design to tailor content and functionality for different devices and contexts.

Accessibility and Inclusiveness:

Implementing features like screen reader support, alternative text for images, and voice navigation to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities.

Adherence to international accessibility standards like the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

Cloud Mobile Engine


Device virtualization: camera, microphone, GPS, gyroscope, etc.

Audio and video encoding: software and hardware encoders to achieve high image quality, high efficiency and low resource occupation;

Network transmission: to achieve the balance of image quality, latency and fluency. It adopts the adaptive transmission algorithm, using the hybrid FEC and intelligent ARQ strategy. It can resist network jitters, and maintain the real-time performance of media data low-latency transmission.

Audio and video decoding: adaptation and optimization decoder for different mobile devices;

Input control synchronization: adapt to the control mode of different terminal devices, and support multi-screen interaction with same cloud mobile device;

Keys, Points & $PHONE
What are "Keys"? 
"Keys" refer to In-app "currency" used to open treasure boxes. The treasure boxes offer users a variety of rewards like keys and points that can be exchanged for token airdrops, giving players exciting incentives as they engage with the games. 

Keys are spent each time you open a box in-app. Your keys can be stolen by others if you don't play for 36 hours

How to earn Keys?
Successfully binding an invite code, you will receive 10 keys as an one-time reward.

By purchasing an annual card, you will earn 100 keys.

Activate a trial card and receive 10 keys; After valid activation, you will receive 10 keys for 6 consecutive days.

Steal keys from other users in-game

Daily key rewards, only applicable to annual card users

How are Daily Key Rewards calculated?
(Aphone cloud phone remaining months rounded up* 10) + (NFT quantity * 36) + (SBT quantity * 60)

Alice holds 1 NFT, 1 SBT and 1 cloud phone for one year, and can receive:
 

How will Keys be stolen from users after inactivity? 
Keys can be stolen if the last activity was more than 36 hours ago

Valid activities: purchasing a card, opening a box

For example, if a user has 500 Keys and has not logged into the dApp for over 36 hours, the first time they can be stolen from, the maximum loss is 100 Keys. After losing 100 Keys, there is a 36 hour protection period. If after 36 hours they still have not logged in, the second time they can be stolen from, the maximum loss is 80 Keys. After losing 80 Keys, there is another 36 hour protection period, and so on, until the user's Keys are below 5, at which point they cannot be further stolen from.

If a user persists in taking action daily - purchasing a card, opening a box - they will gain a 36 hour protection period each time, during which they cannot be stolen from.

What are Points?
Points can be converted into $PHONE tokens. 

How to earn points?
Open treasure boxes

How much $PHONE can I get in the Season 1 airdrop?
After each season ends, the ratio of points to $PHONE tokens will be determined based on total user points and the airdrop token supply.

Users can calculate their airdrop amount by multiplying their own points by the ratio.

During this period, if 643,823,123,483 Points were generated in total. The corresponding ratio would be 1 $PHONE = 30.66 Points. Therefore, for the first airdrop, a total of 21,000,000,000 $PHONE will be distributed. 

If a user has 100,000 Points at the end of this period, then the user can exchange up to 100,000 / 30.66 = 3,261.5786 $PHONE.

Users can choose not to convert their points for now, and wait until the second season instead. In the second season, it is possible that the same amount of Points could be converted into more $PHONE tokens than season 1.

Can points be transferred?
No, neither users nor the Aphone team can transfer a user's points.

Points will only decrease when converted into tokens, and there will be records of this (Users can click the Points icon on the game page to see records).

Top users on the leaderboard hold an insane number of points. And I can't earn many points from the games. Is it still worth participating?
Points from the first season can be exchanged for tokens in the second or third periods. 100 points in the first period may equal 10 $PHONE tokens, but 100 points in the second season could be for 50 $PHONE tokens.

In the games, you will also have a chance to directly win $PHONE rewards, which will be airdropped to you at the end of the period (functionality still being finalized).


Airdrop Season 1
Be among the first to gain exclusive access to APhone through our Season 1 airdrop! We're granting Alpha invites only via NFT drops. Soon you will receive $PHONE tokens as exclusive rewards.

Overview:
Season 1 will be the initial alpha test phase for APhone, with access granted only via invite codes. 10% of the total supply $PHONE will be used as incentives during Season 1. At the conclusion of Alpha testing, NFTs will become transferable and the holding cap will be removed.

NFT Details:
There will be an initial supply of 50,000 APhone NFTs, increasing later based on demand.

The maximum NFT holding cap per account is 30 during Season 1.

NFTs will be non-transferable during the alpha test phase.


Referral Program
Aphone's referral program is designed to deliver a gamified experience to earn with your network while enjoying the decentralized cloud-based smartphones.

Inviters earn “Key” rewards when invited users purchase annual cards:

Direct invite: 16%

2nd-degree invite: 8%

For every friend you refer, you will receive 16% of their keys, for every friend that your referral refers, you will receive 8% of their keys!

What is an "Invite Code"?
Invite codes are the only way to enter APhone.

How to get Invite Codes?
Each 1-Year Pass (NFT) rewards 3 invitation codes.

1 1-Year Pass = 3 invitation codes. 

The invitee purchases 1-Year Pass (NFT) to reward the inviter 1 invitation code. 

1 1-Year Pass = 1 invitation code.

If Alice invites Bob, and Bob purchases 3 annual cards, then:

Alice will receive 3 invitation codes (Bob's number of purchased annual cards * 1)

Bob will receive 9 invitation codes (Bob's number of purchased annual cards * 3)

How to share Invite Codes?
User Center  (Tab 3) → Invitation Code → Copy → Share
